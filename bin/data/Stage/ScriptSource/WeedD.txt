He's right here.
Su-.
Come on, I promise he'll be good.
He even saved me from P-
...

He what?
Oh, nevermind.
Listen, I doubt some random
stranger would just throw
their life away just because
this annoying girl asked them to.
Do you really want to search for an
exit there?<ENDP

What. Please tell me you're joking.
